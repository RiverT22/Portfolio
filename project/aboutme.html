<h2>-Hello! I see you wanted to know more!-</h2>
<h3>My name is River, (Yes as in water) and as you can see I love Korean music and Sailor Moon (hehe)</h3>

<h3>Some questions:</h3>
<h3>Why did I add Sailor Moon on each page?</h3>
<h4>I wanted to add something related and cute, so I thought Sailor Moon would be a good idea!</h4>
<h3>Why is my idea so specific?</h3>
<h4>When thinking about this project, I started to think about one of my new favorite boy bands, Stray Kids. They helped me get through emotions when I wasn't feeling well and made me reflect on how music as impacted my mental wellbeing since middle school. The lyrics touched my heart and helped me feel better :)</h4>
<h3>Why kpop?</h3>
<h4>I wanted to bring something a little more different, and expose the world to more than just knowing BTS.</h4>
<h3>Why do I not see some bands?</h3>
<h4>Unfortunately I was not able to put every song link to every category I wanted to, but I do listen to more artists than this!</h4>
<h3>What's your favorite song at the moment, and why?</h3>
<h4>Probably Mixtape 3 by Stray Kids. It's a calming and motivating song singing about how hard you've worked and to keep going, because blessings wait for you!</h4>
