<h1>I see you wanted to know more. Here ya go!</h1>

<h3>My idea for this website was to bring more awareness to taking care of yourself more often!</h3>

<h2>Did you know?</h2>
<h3>•It has been proven that music is a great way to de stress and we all know it's good to lessen stress.</h3>
<h3>•Positive Psychology has found that intrinsical motivation is more successful than externally motivated behavior </h3>

<h4>-->Intrinsical movivation is internal motivation, like having the motivation to finish something for your own satisfaction.</h4>
<h4>-->Extrinsical motivation is external motivation, like having a physical motivation to finish something like a physical reward</h4>

<h3>In a resarch study it shows when men listen to mysogonistic lyrics, they became more aggressive towards women</h3>
<h4>•However, Jack R. Christianson(Another researcher) said “I’m not going to say that if you listen to ‘bad’ lyrics you’re going to go out and do what the lyrics suggest, but the dominating thoughts that you have in your mind are what drive your behaviors. The music allows you to remember the lyric.” </h4>
<h3>Using this logic, this can mean this can happen to motivational music too!  </h3>
<h3>More research shows certain people (depending on the kind of person you are) Use sad music as an outlet when they're sad and feel better!</h3>
<h3>But of course, there's also people who feel happier listening to happy music when sad!</h3>
